"""
Block optimization engine — OR-Tools CP-SAT.

This is the technical core of the prototype: given a set of maintenance tasks
in the same section, find the minimum-span combined block that fits all of
them back-to-back, subject to the maintenance window. (Train-conflict
avoidance during an ACTIVE block is handled live by conflict_monitor.py,
not baked into this solve — see the demo scenario notes.)

For the "3 requests -> 1 block" headline number: this takes N separate task
durations and returns ONE block whose span is the sum of durations (plus a
small buffer), instead of N separate blocks.

    This is intentionally simple for the prototype: since all 3 tasks are in
    the same section and none conflict with each other, CP-SAT's job here is
    to find a valid non-overlapping ORDER (respecting priority as a soft
    preference) that packs them into the minimum total span. At larger scale
    (many sections, many tasks, train windows as forbidden intervals) this is
    where the solver's real value shows up.
